# Data-Science-BootCamp-2
Well, we covered *DATA CLEANING*
*DATA CLEANING* is the process of detecting and removing corrupts or inaccurate record from dataset.
*Task involved in Data Cleaning*
1. *Removing irrelevant data*
It involves row and column deleting. Actually, we can delete single or multiple column or row.

2. *Handling duplicated data*
This involves two steps. First checking if there are any duplicates, if yes, we delete them. But if no, we dodge this task.
3. *Converting Data Types*
Actually, we can used python dictionary, apply and lambda function to convert data types. But not only that but we can use *LabelEncoder* to convert categorical data to numeric data.
4. *Handling missing values*
We can handle missing values by deleting any cell with missing value. Moreover, we can fill in the cell of missing value by one of the two way. First, filling with 0 or filling with mean of column.
5. *Handling typos*
These are incorrect spelling in dataset, happened during data entry. Actually, we can correct for any mis typed word once we have noticed it. 
6. *Handling outliers*
First, we can check outlier by using zero score, then after we can drop them.
If youâ€™re ready to go choose one of the following machine learning projects and do that.
*Thanks for your time, stay safe and stay positive*
